# by Eng.Ali Majed

This project is an application designed to teach kids about cybersecurity concepts and equip 
them with the necessary skills to protect themselves online. The application covers topics such as
passwords, data encryption, phishing, viruses, cyberbullying and identity theft in an easy-to-understand and 
concise way. It is tailored for kids between 6 to 13 years old, so it uses engaging graphics, simple language and interactive games
to illustrate the concepts. To facilitate the learning process, the application also includes puzzles and quizzes which aim to assess
and reinforce their knowledge. By doing so, it increases their level of engagement and simplifies the topics in a fun and educative way. 
This project is a great way to introduce children to
cybersecurity and provide them with the tools to protect their identity and stay safe while browsing the web.
